I learned how to handle various aspects of web development using Node.js, including setting up a static web server, working with JSON, using the Postman utility, and managing environment variables with .env. I also delved into request parameters, query strings, setting status codes, handling multiple responses, creating route files, using ES modules, and handling request body data. Additionally, I explored making POST, PUT, and DELETE requests, using middleware and custom error handlers, employing the Colors package, and structuring code with controllers. I also learned about the _dirname workaround, making requests from the frontend, submitting forms to an API, and setting up the EJS template engine to pass and loop over arrays and create template partials.
